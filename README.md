# Reinforcement Learning with Robust Stability Guarantee

## Conda environment
From the general python package sanity perspective, it is a good idea to use conda environments to make sure packages from different projects do not interfere with each other.


To create a conda env with python3, one runs 
```bash
conda create -n test python=3.6
```
To activate the env: 
```
conda activate test
```

### MuJoCo
Some of the baselines examples use [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org) (multi-joint dynamics in contact) physics simulator, which is proprietary and requires binaries and a license (temporary 30-day license can be obtained from [www.mujoco.org](http://www.mujoco.org)). Instructions on setting up MuJoCo can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)
